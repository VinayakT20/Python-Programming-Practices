# Python-Programming-Practices

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts demonstrating various concepts in object-oriented programming and algorithm implementation.

## Scripts Overview

1. **Pract1.py**: 
   Demonstrates the creation of a class with instance attributes and a class attribute. It shows how to create objects from the class and access their attributes.

2. **Pract2.py**: 
   Illustrates the use of class methods in Python. It defines a class representing a college and uses a class method to print the college name.

3. **Pract3.py**: 
   Showcases inheritance in Python. It defines a parent class 'thane' and a child class 'mumbai' that inherits from it, demonstrating how to use the `super()` function to call the parent class's __init__ method.

4. **Pract4.py**: 
   Demonstrates polymorphism in Python using two classes with methods of the same name. It shows how different objects can be treated uniformly despite having different implementations of the same methods.

5. **Pract5.py**: 
   Implements a recursive function to calculate Fibonacci numbers. This script takes user input to determine which Fibonacci number to calculate.

These scripts cover fundamental concepts in Python programming, including:
- Object-oriented programming (classes, objects, attributes)
- Inheritance and the use of `super()`
- Polymorphism
- Class methods
- Recursive functions

Each script is designed to be simple and educational, perfect for beginners learning Python or as quick references for these concepts.
